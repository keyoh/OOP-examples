    "# Intent\n",
    "Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.\n",
    "# Motivation\n",
    "It's important for some classes to have exactly one instance. Although there can be\n",
    "many printers in a system, there should be only one printer spooler. There should be\n",
    "only one file system and one window manager. A digital filter will have one A/D\n",
    "converter. An accounting system will be dedicated to serving one company.\n",
    "How do we ensure that a class has only one instance and that the instance is easily\n",
    "accessible? A global variable makes an object accessible, but it doesn't keep you from\n",
    "instantiating multiple objects.\n",
    "A better solution is to make the class itself responsible for keeping track of its sole\n",
    "instance. The class can ensure that no other instance can be created (by intercepting\n",
    "requests to create new objects), and it can provide a way to access the instance. This is\n",
    "the Singleton pattern."
