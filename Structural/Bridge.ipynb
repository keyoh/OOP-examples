    "# Intent\n",
    "Bridge is a structural design pattern that divides business logic or huge class into separate class hierarchies that can be developed independently.\n",
    "work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. \n",
    "# Motivation\n",
    "The Bridge pattern is especially useful when dealing with cross-platform apps, supporting multiple types of database servers or working with several API providers of a certain kind (for example, cloud platforms, social networks, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use the Adapter pattern when\n",
    "• you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its\n",
    "implementation. This might be the case, for example, when the implementation\n",
    "must be selected or switched at run-time. \\\n",
    "• both the abstractions and their implementations should be extensible by\n",
    "subclassing. In this case, the Bridge pattern lets you combine the different\n",
    "abstractions and implementations and extend them independently. \\\n",
    "• changes in the implementation of an abstraction should have no impact on\n",
    "clients; that is, their code should not have to be recompiled. "
